net: spacemit: Hold RTNL lock in emac_resume() and emac_suspend()

This patch takes rtnl_lock() around the emac_open() call in emac_resume()
and around the emac_stop() call in emac_suspend(). The aim is to silence
a lockdep "suspicious RCU usage" warning from phy_disconnect(), which
reads a pointer with rtnl_dereference().

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch. It sits
in the function being changed, though. What state is the device left
in when emac_open() fails here?

By this point the unwind in emac_open() has freed the TX/RX rings. One
of two things has also happened:

- emac_up() failed, and its error path called phy_disconnect() and
  pm_runtime_put_sync().
- emac_phy_connect() failed, and ndev->phydev is still NULL from the
  previous suspend.

The IRQ is not requested and NAPI is disabled. emac_resume() then gates
bus_clk and returns, but __LINK_STATE_START and IFF_UP are still set.

The next "ip link set down", unregister, or emac_suspend() (which sees
netif_running() as true) would then run:

emac_stop()
  emac_down()
    phy_disconnect(ndev->phydev)   <- phydev is NULL
      phy_is_started(phydev)       <- dereferences phydev->state

Can this oops?

Past that point, emac_down() would:

- write MAC registers with the bus clock gated
- call free_irq() on an IRQ that is not requested
- call napi_disable() on a NAPI that is already disabled
- underflow the runtime PM usage count

Also, emac_clean_rx_desc_ring() would index the NULL rx_desc_buf, and
emac_suspend() would call clk_disable_unprepare(priv->bus_clk) a second
time.

Separately, emac_alloc_tx_resources() and emac_alloc_rx_resources()
kfree() the buffer array when dma_alloc_coherent() fails, but they do
not set the pointer to NULL:

	if (!tx_ring->desc_addr) {
		kfree(tx_ring->tx_desc_buf);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}

Could a later teardown free tx_desc_buf (or rx_desc_buf) a second time
through that stale pointer?

[Severity: Medium]
emac_suspend() checks netif_running() to decide whether to call
emac_stop(). That check runs before rtnl_lock() and is not repeated
under the lock:

	if (!ndev || !netif_running(ndev)) {
		clk_disable_unprepare(priv->bus_clk);
		return 0;
	}

	rtnl_lock();
	emac_stop(ndev);

Can another RTNL holder close the device in between?

Here is one example. The netdev is moved into a netns, and that netns
is torn down as system sleep starts. cleanup_net runs on netns_wq,
which is not freezable. It holds RTNL and calls dev_close(), which
calls emac_stop().

Meanwhile emac_suspend() has already seen netif_running() as true. It
blocks in rtnl_lock(), then runs emac_stop() a second time. There,
emac_down() calls phy_disconnect(ndev->phydev) with phydev already
NULL, and phy_is_started() dereferences it.

emac_resume() has the mirror case. It also tests netif_running() before
rtnl_lock(), so it could call emac_open() on a device that was just
closed. That would leak the rings, the IRQ and the PHY attach.

Would it make sense to take rtnl_lock() before the netif_running()
test, with netif_device_detach() / netif_device_attach() inside the
same locked section?

[Severity: Medium]
Does holding RTNL here invert the lock order with tx_timeout_task?
emac_stop()->emac_down() does:

	cancel_work_sync(&priv->tx_timeout_task);

and the work handler takes RTNL first:

emac_tx_timeout_task() {
	...
	rtnl_lock();
	...
}

emac_tx_timeout() queues the work with schedule_work(). That uses the
system workqueue, which is not freezable, so the work can run during
system suspend:

CPU1 (worker)                      CPU2 (suspend)
emac_tx_timeout_task()
                                   emac_suspend()
                                     rtnl_lock()
  rtnl_lock()  <- blocks
                                     emac_stop()
                                       emac_down()
                                         cancel_work_sync()
                                           <- waits for CPU1

cancel_work_sync() goes through __flush_work()->start_flush_work().
That finds the executing worker with find_worker_executing_work() and
waits on a barrier queued behind it.

Can this hang suspend? Lockdep may also report a circular dependency
between rtnl_mutex and the work's lockdep_map, which would swap one
splat for another.

The ndo_stop path (dev_close() under RTNL, then emac_stop()) already
has this pattern. This patch adds it to the system sleep path too.

Could the synchronous cancel be kept out of any RTNL-held section?
Options include cancelling the work before taking RTNL, using
rtnl_trylock() and requeueing in the work, or a disable_work() based
scheme.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but it involves the same
work and RTNL pair. Can emac_tx_timeout_task() wait on itself?

emac_tx_timeout_task()          <- running as priv->tx_timeout_task
  rtnl_lock()
  dev_close(ndev)
    __dev_close_many()
      emac_stop()               <- ndo_stop
        emac_down()
          cancel_work_sync(&priv->tx_timeout_task)

At this point the work is executing, not queued. start_flush_work()
finds the calling worker itself through find_worker_executing_work().
It then inserts a barrier that can only run after the current work
returns, so wait_for_completion() in __flush_work() never returns.

Would every TX timeout recovery leave the worker stuck while holding
rtnl_mutex? That would block every RTNL user. With this patch, the next
emac_suspend() would also block forever in its new rtnl_lock().
