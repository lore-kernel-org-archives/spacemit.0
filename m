Hi,

The DWC PCIe core and its platform drivers repeatedly call
dw_pcie_find_capability(pci, PCI_CAP_ID_EXP) to obtain the offset of the
PCI Express Capability structure, including in paths that run more than
once such as link polling, suspend/resume and interrupt handlers.

Add a cached pcie_cap field to struct dw_pcie and a
dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap() helper that performs the lookup on first use and
caches the result, then convert the core and the 14 platform drivers
that use PCI_CAP_ID_EXP.

After this series, dw_pcie_find_capability(..., PCI_CAP_ID_EXP) no
longer appears in drivers/pci/controller/dwc/ outside of the helper
itself. The only remaining PCI_CAP_ID_EXP user is the per-function
lookup in dw_pcie_ep_init_non_sticky_registers(), which uses
dw_pcie_ep_find_capability() and cannot share the function 0 offset.

Base branch
===========

This series is based on the pci/main branch and applies on top of its
current tip (see the base-commit trailer below), which is the
"pci-v7.4-changes" merge. It should therefore be close to what
v7.4-rc1 will contain.

Design change in v4
===================

v3 cached the offset at one chosen point (dw_pcie_host_init() after
.init, or a driver's PERST# deassert handler) and then read the raw
field everywhere else. As the review pointed out, that model is
fragile: some paths reach the offset before the chosen caching point
(the qcom .post_init callbacks, qcom-ep icc_update() from the global
IRQ, the i.MX6 endpoint path) and it relies on every endpoint driver
remembering to call the helper after enabling hardware.

v4 turns the cache into a lazy lookup: dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap() is called
at every place that needs the offset. The DBI read therefore happens at
exactly the same point as the open coded dw_pcie_find_capability() call
it replaces, so the series does not introduce DBI accesses where the
controller might not be accessible, and no driver has to call the
helper at a particular time. The repeated searches are still
eliminated.

A DBI access performed while the controller is inaccessible is platform
dependent: some integrations hang, some return zero and some return
garbage. Zero self-heals (the lookup is repeated), and to make sure that
a transient bogus non-zero value cannot stick, the offset is only cached
after the capability ID has been read back at that offset. Otherwise the
offset is used for the current access but not cached, and the next call
searches again.

Sashiko review disposition
==========================

As requested, here is the disposition of every non-pre-existing issue
reported by Sashiko on v3:

- Patch 1, "the search is repeated if the capability is not found":
  not a functional issue. The PCIe Capability is mandatory on DWC
  controllers; if it were missing, the hardware would be unusable and
  the only effect is that the (cheap, error path) search is repeated.
  This is now documented in the helper; no negative-cache flag is
  added.

- Patch 1, data race on pci->pcie_cap: the first lookup can be
  triggered from more than one context, so the field is now accessed
  with READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE(). A concurrent lookup stores the same
  value, hence the race is benign and no lock is needed.

- Patches 2, 3, 6, 8, 16, "pci->pcie_cap may be 0 in Endpoint mode":
  valid for v3, fixed in v4. All users, including the endpoint ones, go
  through dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap(), which searches at the point of use, so
  a stale zero offset can no longer corrupt the standard PCI header.

- Patches 2, 6, 8, "unused cap variable and redundant DBI read in
  dw_pcie_link_get_max_link_width()": valid, fixed in patch 2.

- Patch 2, "the commit message claims a warning is printed": valid. The
  claim was wrong (Mani asked the same question) and has been removed;
  no warning is printed and none is needed, because the helper always
  returns the freshly searched value.

- Patch 10, "icc_update() can run before the PERST# handler caches the
  offset": not possible in v4 and not a new issue. The lookup is done
  inside qcom_pcie_ep_icc_update(), exactly where the open coded search
  was before, so this series does not add a DBI access to the global
  IRQ path. The pre-existing races between the global and PERST# IRQ
  threads are out of scope.

- Patch 11, "the qcom .post_init callbacks run before
  qcom_pcie_clear_aspm_l0s() populated the cache": valid for v3, fixed
  in v4. The .post_init callbacks now obtain the offset on their own.

- Pre-existing issues (rockchip and sophgo INTx IRQ domain leak,
  layerscape dw_pcie_dbi_ro_wr_en()/dis() race, spear13xx phy_init() and
  shared IRQ handling, UltraRISC 32-bit RMW of 16-bit registers): all
  acknowledged, but they are not introduced by this series and are left
  for separate fixes.

The layerscape-ep patch keeps Frank's Reviewed-by tag.

The series is build tested with allmodconfig on x86_64
(drivers/pci/controller/dwc/).

Changes in v5:
- Rebase onto the pci/main branch, as suggested by Bjorn, instead of the
  old mainline base.
- Patch 1: only cache the offset after the capability ID has been read
  back at that offset, so a transient bogus DBI read (for example while
  the controller clocks are gated) cannot be cached for the lifetime of
  the controller. The commit message now describes the platform
  dependent behavior of such accesses, as raised in the Rockchip review.
- One redundant dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap() call in
  qcom_pcie_perst_deassert() was dropped; the L1 exit latency is
  programmed with the offset already fetched for the L0s one.

Changes in v4:
- Rework the cache into a lazy lookup done at the point of use; drop the
  explicit caching calls from dw_pcie_host_init() and from the driver
  init/PERST# paths. This removes the whole class of "offset used before
  it is cached" bugs and the need for every endpoint driver to call the
  helper itself.
- Fix the qcom .post_init ordering and the i.MX6, fu740, rockchip,
  UltraRISC and core endpoint paths flagged by Sashiko.
- Fix the redundant lookup and the unused variable in
  dw_pcie_link_get_max_link_width().
- Remove the incorrect "prints a warning" statement from the core patch
  commit message.
- Use READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() for the cached field.
- Audit the whole dwc subtree: all 14 platform drivers using
  PCI_CAP_ID_EXP are converted, and no direct lookup remains.

Changes in v3:
- Remove automatic caching from dw_pcie_ep_init() to prevent unclocked
  DBI access on EP platforms (qcom-ep, tegra194).
- Add explicit dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap() calls in qcom-ep and tegra194 EP
  paths after hardware enablement.
- Keep Host mode caching unchanged.
- Update commit messages accordingly.

Changes in v2:
- Move dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap() from the beginning of dw_pcie_host_init()
  and dw_pcie_ep_init() to after the hardware initialization callbacks
  (host_init/pre_init). This can prevent the reading of DBI when the
  clock is turned off or when the hardware is not ready.
- Convert all platform drivers to use the cached offset via
  dw_pcie_get_pcie_cap() or directly pci->pcie_cap where safe.
- Fix type mismatches (u16 -> u8).
- Properly split per-driver modifications.

Why splitting into per-driver patches
=====================================
To facilitate review and potential bisection, each platform driver is
modified in its own patch. The core changes are in patches 1-2 and the
follow-up patches convert individual glue drivers. If the maintainers
prefer to squash them, please let me know.

This splitting was carried out solely for the convenience of code
review.
